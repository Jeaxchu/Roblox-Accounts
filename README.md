Shits you need to make it works :
1) Browsers (no shits)
2) Tampermonkey extension (absolutely need this to work and no shits)
3) My COCK (must have)

Instruction :
1) Click on Tampermonkey
2) Click "Create a new script"
3) Copy and paste the script
4) Save

Donâ€™t copy all the code into one Tampermonkey script. Instead, copy each code from GitHub (here) and paste it into a separate script in Tampermonkey.
